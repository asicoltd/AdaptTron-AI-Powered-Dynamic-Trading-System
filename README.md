# ðŸ“Š Trading Strategy Pipeline Documentation

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Data Preprocessing

### 1.1 Indicators (Feature Set)
- OHLC data: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`
- Technical indicators:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - EMA, SMA (Exponential & Simple Moving Averages)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Momentum, Stochastic Oscillator

### 1.2 Feature Engineering
- Rolling statistics: mean, std, min, max
- Lag features: `Close_t-1`, `RSI_t-1`, etc.
- Crossover signals: `EMA_9 > EMA_21`, etc.

### 1.3 Normalization/Scaling
- `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` applied only on training data, same scaler used for test/predict.

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Models for Price Prediction

### 2.1 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Sequence model for historical price pattern recognition.

### 2.2 CNN-LSTM
- CNN: Capture local spatial features (short-term trend).
- LSTM: Capture temporal dependencies.

### 2.3 Transformer
- Self-attention-based architecture for long-range dependencies.

### 2.4 ARIMA
- Time series analysis for stationary signals.

### 2.5 XGBoost
- Gradient boosting decision trees.
- Input: engineered features + indicators.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Reinforcement Learning (Algo Trading)

### 3.1 DQN (Deep Q-Network)
- State: Recent price predictions, technical indicators.
- Action: `Buy`, `Sell`, `Hold`
- Reward: Profit/Loss

### 3.2 PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- Actor-Critic method for stable training.
- Adaptable to continuous action spaces.

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Ensemble Strategy

### 4.1 Prediction Fusion
```python
# Example: Weighted average prediction
final_price_prediction = (
    0.2 * lstm_pred +
    0.2 * cnn_lstm_pred +
    0.2 * transformer_pred +
    0.2 * arima_pred +
    0.2 * xgboost_pred
)
```

### 4.2 Final Trading Signal
- Input: Price predictions + historical signals
- Model: `DQN` or `PPO` to output final `Buy/Sell/Hold`

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Model Training Process

### 5.1 Data Loading
- Load multiple timeframes (e.g., 1min, 5min, 15min)
- Use `sliding window` approach for sequential input generation

### 5.2 Model Training
- Train `LSTM`, `CNN-LSTM`, `Transformer` using MSE/MAE loss
- Optimize `XGBoost` with cross-validation and `GridSearchCV`
- Fit `ARIMA` with `auto_arima` or manual tuning

### 5.3 Reinforcement Learning
- Simulated environment built with historical data
- RL state = `[price_preds, indicators, position_state]`
- Reward = P&L, drawdown penalty, transaction cost

---

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Backtesting
- Use **Backtrader** or **Zipline** for historical simulation
- Evaluate:
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Maximum Drawdown
  - CAGR
  - Win Rate
  - Profit Factor

---

## âœ… Future Enhancements
- Add sentiment analysis (e.g., news/tweets).
- Train on live-streamed data (using WebSocket/REST).
- Add risk management layer: Stop-loss, Take-profit.
