ðŸ“Œ Strategy Breakdown
Data Preprocessing

Indicators: Open/Close Prices, Bullish/Bearish Signals (e.g., RSI, MACD, EMA)
Feature Engineering: Additional indicators like Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, etc.
Normalization/Scaling: MinMax or StandardScaler for features.
Models for Price Prediction:

LSTM: For sequential prediction using historical prices.
CNN-LSTM: To capture both short-term features (CNN) and long-term trends (LSTM).
Transformer: Apply self-attention to model dependencies across longer timeframes.
ARIMA: Baseline for time series forecasting (stationary data).
XGBoost: For boosting decision trees, combining multiple features (indicators, OHLC).
Reinforcement Learning (Algo Trading)

DQN: Used to estimate Q-values for choosing optimal actions (buy, sell, hold).
PPO: A more stable reinforcement learning technique for policy optimization.
Ensemble Strategy:

Prediction Fusion: Combine predictions from all models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, ARIMA, XGBoost) using a weighted average.
Final Trading Signal: Use DQN or PPO to decide on trading actions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on price predictions and historical signals.
ðŸ“Œ Model Training Process:
Data Loading:

Load different timeframes from your dataset.
Prepare time-series data with sliding windows for LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer.
Model Training:

Train each model separately for price prediction.
Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation (for XGBoost and ARIMA).
Reinforcement Learning:

Train the DQN and PPO with simulated trading environments using historical data.
Integrate price predictions as part of the environment state for RL models.
Backtesting:

Use Backtrader/Zipline to simulate the performance of the ensemble strategy.
