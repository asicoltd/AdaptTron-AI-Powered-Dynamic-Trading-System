## Architecture

AdaptTron's architecture is designed in five key stages:

1. **Noise Filtering:**  
   Preprocess market data by removing irrelevant noise using wavelet, FFT, and entropy measures, ensuring the subsequent modules work with cleaner signals.

2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Extract robust features from the preprocessed data using deep learning (LSTM and CNN) and statistical models (GMM) to capture both temporal and spatial dependencies.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**  
   Detect complex market patterns and trends using transformer models, autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making.

4. **Meta-Learning Adaptation:**  
   Dynamically adapt to evolving market conditions with meta-learning frameworks like MAML, supported by Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters on the fly.

5. **Trading Strategy Execution:**  
   Execute the optimal trading strategy in real time based on the insights derived from the earlier stages, ensuring robust risk management and portfolio optimization.
